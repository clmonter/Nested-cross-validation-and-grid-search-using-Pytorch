# Nested cross-validation using Pytorch
This repository is used to perform nested cross validation on a single hidden layer MLP using Pytorch. 

The code was initially implemented to perform a comparison between different sets of audio features for acoustic scene classification on a given dataset.
However, the code is adaptable for any different type of problem. It is also adaptable to train different models.
